<span class="is-first-letter">A</span> few months ago I wrote a post in which I shared my thoughts on my ownership experience with my Fiesta ST. In it, I highlighted a number of the the ST's strengths: its handling, peppy personality, and balance of power and efficiency. Over the past three years its been reliable, surprisingly practical, and overall a blast to drive. However, at the end of that post, I also touched on a few of the ways I felt I'd outgrown the ST, noting that I felt ready for an upgrade.  I alluded to my dream of owning a Subaru WRX, but didn't explain exactly why.

#### Why a WRX?

As a product of the Need For Speed/Fast and Furious generation, owning a WRX has been a dream of mine since I was tall enough to reach the TV. Unfortunately, I've never seriously pursued that dream, as finding a clean, well-maintained used WRX is laughably impossible, and new ones have always been out of my budget.

Shortly after picking up a Fiesta ST back in 2014, I made a promise to myself: that the next car I purchased **would be** a WRX. After three long years of dreaming, planning, and saving, I found myself finally ready to pull the trigger, and placed my order for a 2018 WRX Premium in Lapis Blue Pearl in late July.

With an ETA of 10-12 weeks, I knew I'd need some way to distract myself. In order to help pass the time, I decided I should document my experience!

This post will be the first in a series designed to share my WRX journey in detail, from research and ordering, to purchasing, maintenance, and modding.  I'll identify a few things to know if/when you decide to start shopping for a new WRX of your own. As somebody who's spent an inordinate amount of time scouring forums, magazines, YouTube, and dealerships for information on the WRX, I'll do my best to distill everything into an organized, easy to understand format.

Let's start with a little history lesson.

#### What's makes a WRX?

The Subaru WRX was first introduced in 1992 as a high performance variant of the Impreza. With roots in performance rallying, and offering a unique blend of reliability, performance, it was an instant hit. Unfortunately, it took over ten years for the WRX to arrive in the North American market. Since then, there have been a number of evolutions of the WRX, each advancing the nameplate with unique performance, refinement, and styling improvements.

#### What's new for 2018?

With the latest generation of WRX (2015-present), Subaru opted for more subdued styling and focused on a more refined driving experience. However, the basic ingredients of the WRX formula are still there: all-wheel drive, massive hood scoop, flat-four turbo "Boxer" engine, based on the Impreza chassis.

For 2018, Subaru continued its tradition of "face-lifting" the WRX every three years of a six year model cycle. The WRX was given much-needed updates in two important areas: refinement and styling. While power delivery remains unchanged from the FA20 DIT engine, with 268hp and 258 lb-ft of torque, the cabin has been outfitted with higher resolution displays, gauges, and soft-touch materials. Thicker front glass, door seals, and a foam-filled header beam were added in an effort to reduce unwanted road noise. Additional improvements were made to the transmission synchros and clutch mechanism, resulting in a smoother shifting experience overall.

#### Why would I want one?

Arguing "which car is best" is pointless, but for me, the appeal of the WRX boils down to:

- *Performance* - The numbers speak for themselves: 268 hp, 258 lb-ft torque, symmetrical AWD, 0-60 in approximately five seconds. Plus, if you're brave enough, a light tune and bolt-ons can easily see those numbers break 300.
- *Practicality* - Being based on the Impreza, the WRX is a spacious vehicle for its size. In addition, excellent visibility all around helps contribute to an open feeling cabin. Four doors, a surprisingly spacious trunk (sadly no hatchback option), and standard roof rails (revived for 2018) make the WRX a great option for a daily driver.
- *Safety* - An IIHS Top Safety Pick, the WRX exemplifies Subaru's commitment to safety. In addition, for drivers like myself who find themselves confronted with snow and/or rain on a regular basis, the tried-and-true AWD system inspires confidence and control.
- *Aftermarket* - A healthy aftermarket (both performance and cosmetic) means you'll be hard pressed to find identical WRXs roaming the roads.  Door switches, climate control knobs, fender flares, headlights, taillights, etc.  You name it, somebody makes an aftermarket version of it.
- *Reliability* - Market research supports the brand's touted reliabilty with "98% of Subaru vehicles sold in the last 10 years are still on the road today". (IHS, 2017)
- *Ethics* - In an age of news peppered with "emission scandal" or "bankruptcy" headlines, automakers are under increasing pressure from consumers to be more environmentally-conscious as well as transparent.  Meanwhile, Subaru has continuously demonstrated a proactive attitude towards the environment.  By becoming the first "Zero-Landfill" American automaker as well as contributing to environmental sustainability research and development, Subaru has done an admirable job of putting their resources where it counts.
- *Community* - Ahhh the "Subie Wave". There isn't a day that passes that I don't see two Subarus giving each other the "nod" as they pass on the road. With some of the most active forums and clubs in the world, from teenagers to retirees, it seems everyone appreciates a Subaru when they see one.

#### I want one - Now what?

For the sake of brevity and simplicity, I'm going to assume you're interested in ordering a new one directly from the dealership.  I won't be discussing the used WRX market, but suffice to say there are always at least a few for sale.  However, it can be nearly impossible to track down an un-modified, low-mileage, affordable one. At the end of the day, it's always going to be a lot easier to walk into a dealership and order one yourself.  Not to mention, you have the peace of mind of knowing exactly how it was maintained/driven!

At this point, you'll want to figure out what kinds of features are important to you, as the WRX comes in three main trim levels (we're not covering the STI here): Base, Premium, and Limited. For example, if you're the type of person who needs leather seats, a sunroof, and in-car navigation, you'll have to pony up for a Limited trim. For comparison, here's an super-simplified breakdown of the differences between the trim levels:

- *Base* - 17" wheels, halogen headlights, heated mirrors, 6.2" touch screen, cloth seats
- *Premium* - 18" wheels, fog lights, 7" touch screen, moonroof, heated cloth seats, optional CVT transmission
- *Limited* - LED steering-responsive headlights, keyless push-button start, leather seats with power adjustments

NOTE: For more details on the different trims [cars101.com](http://www.cars101.com) is sort of the internet's unofficial "Subaru encyclopedia".

In my opinion, the Premium trim level is the best value, as it adds a number of important upgrades (nicer wheels, better stereo touchscreen, heated seats) over the Base model. Some argue that the Base is all that's necessary, but items like heated seats or a sunroof aren't readily available as aftermarket options, so you'll need to keep that in mind.

#### So how much should I pay?

Factory pricing for the 2018 is as follows (invoice/MSRP):

- Base - $26,323/$27,855
- Premium (manual) - $28,446/$30,155
- Premium (CVT) - $29,547/$31,355
- Limited (manual) - $30,568/$32,455
- Limited (CVT) - $31,669/$33,655

NOTE: These prices include the required $860 "destination and delivery" charge.

A closer look at the official pricing sheet from Subaru reveals a number of additional fees like "hold-back", "marketing assistance", "floor plan", and "gas allowance". Simply put, these items are basically an allowance extended to the dealership from Subaru for various expenses associated with selling the car. As this information is not widely advertised, most dealerships won't even itemize them separately when listing the vehicle for sale. In negotiating with a dealership, some amount of these "kickbacks" below invoice can be sacrificed in an effort to give a better price, but don't expect too much wiggle room.

On that note, one important distinction to make between Subaru and other manufacturers is the almost complete lack of incentives. With low-volume, high-demand, specialty vehicles like the WRX in particular, Subaru doesn't need to offer special incentives to sell them. This is atypical when compared to the numerous "manufacturer discounts" offered by other brands. For example, when I cross-shopped the WRX with a new GTI, the Volkswagen dealership I talked to was able to immediately offer $1,500 off the MSRP thanks to a current "manufacturer incentive" on top of a load of other discounts. WRX's are different; dealerships know they will sell, so there's no need to lure in buyers with steep discounts right out of the gate.

#### How do I get the best price?

Negotiation tactics vary widely from dealership to dealership. Some dealerships won't budge on their sticker price, and will laugh you away if you walk in looking for a discount, while others will publicly advertise their cars for well under MSRP. It all depends on your region and dealerships.

Thankfully, there's a secret weapon you can use to negotiate almost any dealership below invoice, and it's called Heuberger Subaru.

#### Heuberger Subaru

Heuberger Subaru is the nation's highest-volume Subaru dealership. Since they're allocated and sell so many vehicles, they're able to offer their cars for *significantly* lower margins than other dealerships.  In addition, Heuberger's online sales team regularly solicits sales via a number of the most popular Subaru forums, like [IWSTI](http://www.iwsti.com), [NASIOC](http://www.nasioc.com), and [ClubWRX](http://www.clubwrx.net).

If you're ready to purchase, you'll want to get a quote from their internet sales team.  As of writing, Tom Kushnerick ([thomask@hmtrs.com](mailto:thomask@hmtrs.com)) currently handles most forum orders. Tom is extremely responsive and willing to answer any and all questions about WRX ordering. Most importantly, he's able to provide you with a no-hassle quote over email. Below is an example of the type of email you'll want to send to him:

<blockquote>Hi Tom,

My name is (your name here), and I am in the market for a new 2018 WRX. I've seen Heuberger mentioned on numerous forums with great feedback, so I thought I'd reach out to you!

I'm looking at a (trim here) in (color here) with the following options:

- (options here)

What would be the best price you can do? Since I'm located in (state here), would you be able to provide a shipping quote to (zip here) as well?

Thank you in advance for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you!


Kind regards,

(your name here)</blockquote>

Depending on the time of year, you should hear back within a few business days. He may have a few questions, but should provide a quote that looks something like this:

<blockquote>Vehicle Model and Trim Level
JUO
2018 WRX Premium 6MT
Color
Any

Port Installed Accessories
None
(unless you tell us to add something)

Dealer Installed Accessories
None
(unless you tell us to add something)

MSRP - $30,155
Invoice Price - $28,446
Forum Exclusive Price - $27,374
Total Price Including $489 Dealer Handling $27,863
Optional Cost of Shipping to ZIP code provided: approximately $725 up to $775 depending on the cost of fuel when your WRX gets here from the factory (or you can come get it !)

If you are financing the vehicle, you will need to calculate a $27.20 titling fee and your local tax on top of this as well. License, registration fees, and plates will be due at your local DMV no matter what, and those costs are decided on by your local government.

It only takes a $1,000 deposit to start your build order, or to secure a car that’s already here. That deposit can be taken over the phone with a major credit card. When you’re ready to start the process, call me or David O’Berto (the boss) at (719) 866-6411. Your deposit does of course come off the purchase price of the vehicle.

Please allow us the opportunity to handle your finance business. One of the ways we keep our forum pricing so low, is by capturing a small fee from the lenders, while meeting or beating your pre-approved rate. We also offer competitive pricing on window tinting, clear masks, and paint protection packages. Let me know if you’d like any of the options installed before we ship the car to you.

If you’d rather drive your new car home, we do offer courtesy pickup at Colorado Springs Airport and Denver International Airport. When flying into Denver International, please make sure to arrive between 9am to 2pm, Monday through Friday or we cannot offer courtesy pickup (I’m off Thursdays FYI). If you’re flying into the Springs, I can come get you between 9-4pm Monday through Saturday (except Thursdays).Please reach out to me directly before booking any flights to make sure I can assist you in person !

Thank you again for your potential business, I look forward to helping you get your new Subie!!</blockquote>

And that's it! At this point, you can always accept Tom's offer and purchase the vehicle through Heuberger.  However, Heuberger's quote can also be used as leverage with local dealerships.

#### Negotating with other dealerships

Simply take the vehicle sale price as quoted by Heuberger, add any applicable fees and email your local dealership(s) like so:

<blockquote>To whom it may concern,

My name is (insert name here) and I am in the market for a new 2018 WRX.

I have been in communication with Heuberger Subaru in Colorado about ordering from them, and they have quoted me at (Heuberger price here) out-the-door (including taxes, delivery, fees, etc.).

Since you're a more local dealership, I'd much prefer to do business with you. What would be the best price you can do?

Thank you in advance for your time.


Kind regards,

(your name here)</blockquote>

Now you wait! If a dealership is serious about earning your business, they should reply in a few days. In my experience, there will be some dealerships who insist on talking over the phone. If you are willing, this can be a good opportunity to get a feel for the type of salesperson you'll be working with. If they simply email you back a quote of their own, even better! Once you receive a quote you're happy with, you have one of two options:

1. You can choose to proceed with ordering from that dealership. At this point, if you haven't already, I would recommend giving the salesperson a call to gauge their personality and attitude over the phone. While the car buying process should be as non-personal as possible (to minimize emotions and therefore the risk of overpaying), it's always nice to know the person in charge of your order will be responsive and enjoyable to work with.
2. If you have a specific dealership in mind, and their initial quote is higher than other local offers, now is the time to leverage these quotes to your advantage. Take the best price you've gotten thus far (excluding Heuberger) and send your dealership of choice an email notifying them you have gotten a better offer from another, more local dealership. 9/10 times they will match or beat the offer.

Once you've agreed on a price, it's time to get a written quote. I chose to go into the dealership and get a printed copy of the quote for my records (just in case they try and raise the sale price later). In addition, most dealerships will require a refundable deposit (typically $500 in my experience) to secure your order.

NOTE: It is a good idea to pay this deposit on a credit card, as well as get a receipt. That way, if the dealership tries to keep your deposit/fails to roll it into the sale price of the vehicle, you have documented proof of your payment and can always dispute the charge with your credit card company. It's always good to clarify that the deposit is refundable, too.

Finally, be sure to share any special requests with your dealership/salesperson. In my case, I requested that they not drill the holes for the USDM plates, as well as not put any dealership decals/stickers on the vehicle. In addition, I asked that they keep the roof/hood wrapping on the car (to make sure it's not washed before I take delivery of it).

It's that simple!  Now relax, congratulate yourself on negotiating the best price, and begin the waiting game.  Most vehicles take 10-12 weeks to be shipped stateside, but I've seen owners report as quickly as 6-8.  It all depends on allocation, availability, configuration, etc.  Vehicles with port-installed options (such as the Homelink mirror, short throw shifter, etc.) may take a bit longer as well.

In the next post, I'll highlight...
