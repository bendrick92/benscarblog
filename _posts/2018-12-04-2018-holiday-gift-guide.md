<span class="is-first-letter">W</span>ith temperatures and snow falling fast, it's to time to start thinking about gifts for the petrolhead in your life! Whether you're one yourself or looking for ideas, I've put together a list of a few of my favorite products to help make your gift giving season a little easier!

#### Adam's Polishes H2O Guard & Gloss

![Adam's H2O Guard & Gloss](https://assets.bpwalters.com/images/bens_car_blog/2018_holiday_gift_guide/adams_h2o.png)

Its hard to recommend just one [Adam's](https://adamspolishes.com/) product, since they absolutely kill it with their Christmas-themed limited edition products every year, but their [H2O Guard & Gloss](https://amzn.to/2PhixWh) is an easy pick, especially for a winter detailer. Perfect for protecting paint in-between washes, it goes on slick and offers easy application (wet or dry) and shine. ([Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2PhixWh))

#### WRX/STI OEM Trunk Hook

If you're like me, your WRX/STI is your everyday car. This means regular trips to the grocery store...and the struggle of keeping your bags upright on the way home. The [Subaru OEM Trunk Hook](https://amzn.to/2UgnBOi) provides an elegant, OEM solution to the problem! It mounts up with no modification to the trunk itself and can even fold away when not needed. ([Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2UgnBOi))

#### WRX Christmas Sweater

Some shameless self-promotion here, but my ["Merry WRXmas" Christmas Sweater](https://www.redbubble.com/people/turbosandtees/works/29190585-merry-wrxmas?p=lightweight-raglan-sweatshirt) was a huge hit last year! I got a ton of comments on it at my work Christmas party - mostly people wondering why my sweater had pistons and a car on it... Regardless, it's perfect for the season! ([Buy on RedBubble](https://www.redbubble.com/people/turbosandtees/works/29190585-merry-wrxmas?p=lightweight-raglan-sweatshirt))

#### Subaru String Art

I stumbled across this awesome [Subaru String Art](https://www.etsy.com/listing/581787226/subaru-car-lover-gift-string-art-decor) on Instagram one day and it immediately made its way onto my Christmas list! It's homemade, Subaru-themed, and classy enough to display on your desk! What more could you ask for? ([Buy on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/581787226/subaru-car-lover-gift-string-art-decor))

#### Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 Lens

If you've got an aspiring photographer on your list, look no further than the [Canon "Nifty Fifty" 50mm f/1.8 Lens](https://amzn.to/2OUIMSF). Its one of the most versitale budget lenses you can buy, and makes for some awesome shots. A vast majority of the shots on this blog and my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/benscarblog) were shot with this lens! ([Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2OUIMSF))

#### Adam's Polishes Wheel Cleaner

Ok I lied - I didn't pick just one Adam's product. Their [Wheel Cleaner](https://amzn.to/2PkxeYx) is just too good to not include here... Plus, it's perfect for washing off all of the snow, salt, and other road grime that accumulates over the winter! If you're really trying to make an impression, go for the full [gallon jug](https://amzn.to/2SzPAad) for the most bang for your buck! ([Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2PkxeYx))

#### Billetworkz Engraved Shift Knob

![Billetworkz Engraved Shift Knob](https://assets.bpwalters.com/images/bens_car_blog/2018_holiday_gift_guide/billetworkz_knob.jpg)

[Billetworkz](https://billetworkz.com) is known in the Subaru community for making some awesome stuff, and their shift knobs are no exception. I picked one up myself (as an early present) and absolutely love it. The quality is incredible, and it adds a nice touch to the interior! There are tons of colors, engravings, and styles to choose from, but I went with the [6-Speed Blue Cosmic Space Knob](https://billetworkz.com/collections/subaru-wrx-6-speed/products/blue-cosmic-6-speed-wrx-japanese) with the Japanese engraving. ([Buy from Billetworkz](https://billetworkz.com/collections/subaru-wrx-6-speed/products/blue-cosmic-6-speed-wrx-japanese))

#### Milwaukee Tool M12 FUEL 1/2" Stubby Impact Wrench

![Milwaukee Tool M12 FUEL 1/2" Stubby Impact Wrench](https://assets.bpwalters.com/images/bens_car_blog/2018_holiday_gift_guide/m12_stubby.png)

I may be biased, but the [Milwaukee Tool M12 FUEL 1/2" Stubby Impact Wrench](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/Products/Power-Tools/Fastening/Impact-Wrenches/2555-20) is the perfect tool for any car enthusiast! Having traditionally targeted the construction trades, Milwaukee has been expanding more and more into the automotive tool space and the 1/2" Stubby is their latest offering. With over 250 ft-lbs of force in a package only 4.6" in length, it's perfect for removing bolts in tight spaces. Its also perfect for safely removing/fastening lug nuts, since it has an auto-shutoff mode to prevent over-tightening bolts. Having had the opportunity to play with it myself, I can safely say its pretty awesome! ([Buy from Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Milwaukee-M12-FUEL-12-Volt-Lithium-Ion-Brushless-Cordless-Stubby-1-2-in-Impact-Wrench-Kit-with-One-4-0-and-One-2-0Ah-Batteries-2555-22/305989026))

#### LEGO Caterham Seven 620R

![LEGO Caterham Seven 620R](https://assets.bpwalters.com/images/bens_car_blog/2018_holiday_gift_guide/lego_caterham.png)

I can't think of a car enthusiast who *wouldn't* want this on their desk! LEGO went above and beyond with the details on this model. Paired with the [Mini Cooper](https://amzn.to/2Qz1KCM) or [Volkswagen Beetle](https://amzn.to/2EfVR7F), it's the perfect compliment to any collection. Just be careful - it can be a slippery slope... If you're feeling extra generous, spring for the [Bugatti Chiron](https://amzn.to/2EhoO3c)! ([Buy on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2QFObBq))
