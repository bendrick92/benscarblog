                <p><img src="https://assets.bpwalters.com/images/bens_car_blog/young_ben.jpg" alt="Me behind the wheel as a five year old"></p>
                <p>Over the years I've met some great people, seen some awesome cars, and mostly just had a blast sharing my hobby with others!  I've owned <a href="/garage">a few different cars</a>, but most recently <a href="/taking-delivery-of-my-wrx">I picked up</a> my dream car: A <a href="/garage/wrx" target="_blank">2018 Subaru WRX</a>.</p>
                <p>Fulfilling this lifelong dream inspired me to find a new and creative way to share my ownership experience with the world.  The result was this website!</p>
                <p>When I'm not behind the wheel or in the garage, I'm usually at <a href="https://www.milwaukeetool.com" target="_blank">the office</a>, playing Xbox, or hanging out with my awesome wife and cat!</p>

                <p>Whether you're a WRX fan yourself or just somebody who loves cars, I hope my journey inspires you!
