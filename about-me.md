                <p><span class="is-first-letter">M</span>y name is Ben Walters, and I'm a Web Developer from Minnesota.  I moved here from Wisconsin after graduating college in 2014 and quickly fell in love with the local car community.  Over the last few years I've met some great people, seen some awesome cars, and mostly just had a blast sharing my hobby with others.</p>
                <p>I've owned <a href="/garage">a few cars</a> over the years, but most recently purchased my dream car - a 2018 Subaru WRX.  This inspired me to find a new, creative way to share my ownership experience with the world.  The result was this website!</p>
                <p>Whether you're a WRX owner yourself, or just somebody who loves cars, I hope my journey inspires you.  Feel free to look around, leave a comment, <a href="mailto:contact@benscarblog.com">email me</a>, or follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/benscarblog/">Instagram</a>.</p>
                <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
