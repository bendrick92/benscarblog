                <p>I've been a car nut as long as I can remember! While my tastes have changed over the years, I've always been fascinated by anything with four wheels and a motor.</p>

                <p>Over the past few years I've met some great people, seen some awesome cars, and mostly just had a blast sharing my hobby with others!  I've owned <a href="/garage">a few cars</a> over the years, but most recently purchased my dream car: A <a href="/garage/wrx" target="_blank">2018 Subaru WRX</a>.  Fulfilling this lifelong dream inspired me to find a new, creative way to share my ownership experience with the world.  The result was this website!</p>

                <p>When I'm not behind the wheel or in the garage, I'm usually at <a href="https://www.milwaukeetool.com" target="_blank">the office</a>, programming for fun, blogging here and over at <a href="https://bpwalters.com" target="blank">bpwalters.com</a>, or with my wonderful fiance and our two cats (they are not fans of being in the car).</p>

                <p>Whether you're a WRX fan yourself or just somebody who loves cars, I hope my journey inspires you!</p>
