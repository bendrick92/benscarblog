                <p>After graduating college in the summer of 2014, I found myself searching for a replacement for my 2000 Mercury Cougar.  Unpredictable alternator issues and a new full-time job left me wanting for something more reliable and preferably turbocharged.  I spent a few weeks looking at used STIs, WRXs, etc. but in the end I found myself behind the wheel of a practically new (1971 miles on the odometer) 2014 Fiesta ST.</p>
                <p>The ST served as my daily driver for a little over three years.  Along the way, I made a few minor performance mods, but wanted to retain the factory warranty.  I never really sunk a ton of money into the vehicle, as I had always planned to upgrade to a WRX at some point in the future.  Overall, my three years with the ST were overwhemingly enjoyable and trouble free.
