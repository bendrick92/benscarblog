                <p><span class="is-first-letter">S</span>hortly after turning 30 in March 2022, I had a mild automotive identity crisis. All joking aside, I did step back and seriously considered what was important to me in a daily driver; many needs and considerations that the WRX, unfortunately, no longer fulfilled.</p>
                <p>As a result, I ended up <a href="/wrx-replacement">evaluating my options</a> and <a href="/wrx-replacement">trading the WRX in</a> for a 2022 Legacy Touring XT! I went with the Touring trim primarily for the gorgeous interior, but also because it still offers enough sportiness to keep things interesting.</p>
                <p>With essentially the same 2.4L turbo under the hood as the new WRX, it's got about the same pep as my old car with oodles more luxury and refinement.</p>

                <p>I absolutely miss my <a href="/garage/wrx">WRX</a>, but even after only a few weeks with the Legacy, I've come to love its qualities. I'm super excited to start modding it (see below), and to share the journey with you all!</p>
                <p>For more posts on the Legacy, check out list below (in chronological order):</p>

                <p>My plan for the Legacy is to focus on maintaining comfort and refinement while adding a bit of sportiness. I'll be exploring my options for suspension, wheels and tires, etc., but being realistic - the aftermarket for the Legacy platform is almost non-existent compared to what was available for the WRX!</p>
                <p>That being said, I'm very excited to see what's possible and to build what I think a perfect cross between the WRX and Legacy <em>should</em> be.</p>
