<span class="is-first-letter">A</span>s I lay on the ground searching the undertray for the washer I'd just dropped into the WRX's open engine bay, I began to wonder if the days worth of work I had already put into my HID retrofit had been worth it.  After almost four days of undoing and redoing pop clips, bolts, screws, rubber sealant, spray paint, dremeling, trips to the hardware store, I had reason to question my sanity.

Eventually I'd come to appreciate the fruits of my labor a few hours later when I fired up the HIDs for the first time, but to say the project had challenged me would be an understatement.  Fortunately, the result is a lighting setup that wipes the floor with the stock halogen system.  For the money, it's an incredible value and, while I haven't had a chance to directly compare the two, I'm extremely confident the Morimoto system either matches or exceeds the factory LED system in terms of performance.

In researching this project, I quickly grew frustrated by the lack of detail/pictures in a number of important areas.  There a number of great videos/forum threads discussing HID retrofits for the WRX, but thanks to broken links and images, incomplete documentation, or just vague descriptions, I still felt unprepared and anxious about the process.

With this in mind, I've assembled (what I hope is) a very thorough guide to retrofitting the 2015+ WRX with the Morimoto D2S 4.0 bixenon projectors.  When considering the time required for this project, please keep in mind that documenting everything with detailed pictures and step-by-step notes took a good amount of extra effort and added hours to the overall process for me.  That being said, it's not a project for the faint hearted.  Depending on whether or not you paint the housings or add aftermarket c-lights, you'll need at least two to three days to get everything done.  I hope this guide is able to give you a better idea of what you're in for and serve as a reference as you retrofit your own headlights.

If all that sounds intimidating, don't let it scare you!  I'll break things down step-by-step.  First things first, let's explore everything you'll need to do this yourself.

#### Choosing Your Parts

There are a few options available for the 2015+ WRX as far as HID retrofit systems go, but (as of writing) the main two are the Morimoto Mini H1 7.0 and Mini D2S 4.0.  Both have "plug-and-play" kits available from a variety of companies, and both are respectable options for a retrofit.  The D2S 4.0 system is newer, and arguably performs better than the H1 7.0.  See the below video from Lightwerkz comparing the output of both projectors:

As you can see, the D2S 4.0 has a brighter, higher intensity output.  The projector itself is larger, which can be a negative depending the application.  However, it's a non-issue when replacing the 2015+ WRX low beam halogen projector as the D2S 4.0 fits perfectly (with minor adjustments to the housing that I'll highlight later).

Because of this, I opted for the [D2S 4.0 Retro-Quick kit](https://www.lightwerkz.net/index.php/complete-retrofit-kits/application-specific-kits/retro-quik-impreza-15.html) from [Lightwerkz](https://www.lightwerkz.net).  I chose to order from Lightwerkz for a number of reasons, but mainly because I had referenced many of their videos highlighting their 2015+ WRX retrofits.  Caesar and his team do awesome work, and their willingness to help out and answer questions really impressed me.  At a number of important points in my build, I called them up and had an answer/resolution to a problem within a few minutes.

Below is a detailed list of the options I went with (with some adjustments per my findings) for the Retro-Quick kit from Lightwerkz:

* **Bixenon Projectors**: D2S 4.0 (LHD) (USA & CAN)
* **Mounting Hardware**: 15+ Impreza
* **Compatible Ballasts**: Morimoto XB35 (35W)
* **HID Bulbs**: D2S: XB HID 5500K
* **High Beam Splitters (Pair)**: 9005 Female > 9005/9006 Male Splitters
* **Wiring Harness**: HD Relay: H11/H9/H8
* **Headlight Sealant**: Black RetroRubber
* **Rubber Caps**: No

Regarding my choices:

* The mounting hardware includes a set of machined adapter plates for attaching the D2S projectors using the OEM projector mounts.  Because there weren't any instructions included, this part required a little trial and error - I'll go into detail here later on, but rest assured the adapter plates work perfectly.
* I went with the 35W ballasts over the 55W for reliability and longevity.  I had read the 55W ballasts can generate more heat and wear out the other components faster.
* In my research, I found that the Morimoto XB 5500K D2S HID bulbs provide the whitest output; 4500K may be "truer" white, but 5500K has less of a yellow tint.  After running the lights for a few weeks now, I am very satisifed with the temperature output of the 5500K bulbs.  If I had the budget, I would have opted for the Osram 5500K bulbs, so I may upgrade at some point in the future.
* The high beam splitter(s) are not necessary unless you plan to retain the stock high beam bowl.  I hadn't decided whether or not I wanted to black my high beam bowls out at the time of ordering, so I picked up a set to be safe.
* Headlight sealant - some people will say the factory headlight sealant is reusable, but I did not find this to be the case.  As I'll explain a bit later, the OEM sealant was by far and away the most frustrating part of the build for me.  Just spend the few bucks and pick up the RetroRubber.
* Rubber caps - I added these to my order with the understanding that they'd be necessary as the OEM covers wouldn't be compatible with the new D2S projectors.  However, after much trial and error, I wasn't able to find a way to reliably secure these aftermarket caps and ended up finding a solution that reused the factory covers instead.

In addition to the Retro-Quick kit, I picked up the following items:

* **Diode Dynamics C-Lights**: I went with the Diode Dynamics c-lights over the Morimoto for a number of reasons, but mainly due to their whiter output.
* **Diode Dynamics C-Light DRL Harness**: Since I'm using the c-light as my DRL, the DRL harness allows me to bypass the factory DRL (high beam) and have the c-lights on at all times.
* **Smoked Sidemarkers**: If you want to get rid of the orange sidemarker, Subispeed sells drop-in replacement lenses in both clear and smoked varieties.  You can also try tinting the OEM sidemarker, but it's much easier to just replace them altogether.

Other parts needed (assuming you will be painting the housings black):

* **(100) #8 Flat Washers**: You'll need quite a few of these, so grab yourself a box of 100.  These are used for spacing and leveling the new D2S projectors on the headlight frame, as well as mounting the ballasts and other hardware in the engine bay.
* **(10) #8 bolts and nuts (3/4 in)**: These will be used with the washers to mount the HID harnesses/hardware in the engine bay.  I picked up a "combo pack" of machine screws and nuts.
* **(1) Rust-Oleum Grey Plastic Primer**: While the Krylon Plastic spray paint doesn't explicitly require a primer, I felt it wouldn't hurt.  After forgetting to prime a few pieces, I can confirm the primer *does* make a difference.
* **(1) Krylon Fusion Satin Black Plastic Paint**: I ordered a few cans off Amazon, but I believe this stuff is available in most hardware stores as well.  I went with satin as that's what Lightwerkz and other guys have been using.  I contemplated gloss, but am happy with the satin look.  I ended up using a little over half of one can, but you may want to get a few to be safe.
* **(1) Rust-Oleum Frosted Glass**: I used this to add a bit more diffusion to the factory c-light lens.  It added a bit more "pop" to the lenses and contrasts against the black housing nicely.  Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but worth it in my opinion.
* **GE 100% Waterproof Silicone**: This will be needed to seal up any unused holes in the headlight as well as secure the OEM rubber caps to the back of the new projectors.  Any waterproof silicone should do fine.
* **Painters Tape**: Very helpful for masking off the c-light area if you want to keep the chrome reflectivity of the light.  A roll will do just fine.
* **22-18 Gauge Quick Disconnects**: These aren't explicitly necessary, but I found a few of the male connectors on the provided harnesses to be loose, causing a short in the Diode Dynamics c-lights.  I'll go into more detail on this later.

With everything ordered, Lightwerkz had everything shipped in a few days.  Upon receiving the package, I opened and laid everything out to verify nothing was missing.  I *highly* recommend this step as I ended up realizing I had been sent a wrong igniter.  Lightwerkz immediately sent out a replacement igniter.

My one and only complaint regarding Lightwerkz would be they opted to use USPS Ground for their replacement/RMA parts, which meant I had to wait over three days for the correct igniter to arrive.  Having only one igniter didn't prevent me from finishing the project, but did make it signficantly more frustrating to get everything mounted and aligned (I had to swap the single igniter back and forth between the headlights).

I also experienced a dud HID bulb shortly before buttoning everything up.  Again, Lightwerkz was quick to respond and sent out a replacement bulb under warranty.  However, anticipating the wait I went ahead and ordered a replacement from Amazon (thank you Amazon for next day shipping).

These slight hiccups aside, everything arrived well packaged and ready for use.
